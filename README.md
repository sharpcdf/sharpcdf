I like making random bullshit that doesn't contribute to anything (and browsing GitHub when I'm bored)

- I use D for as many projects as I can because I love its syntax(But I typically use it for more low level projects)
- I use Nim and sometimes Go for general, high level projects because of the amount of libraries they have and I think their syntax is simple and nice
- I plan on using Haxe to make games since I don't really want to learn C#, GDScript, or similar
- I still know but rarely(sometimes never) use a few languages like Python, C/C++, Lua, etc.
